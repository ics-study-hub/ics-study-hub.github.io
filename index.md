## OVERVIEW
COVID-19 has hit not just America, but the entire world very hard. From the workplace to home, people are struggling and education is now more important than ever. We are hoping that our template for the ICS Study Hub will provide the support needed for ICS students and hopefully provide a template for study websites not just all over the country, but as well as across the globe.

## Deployment

A live deployment of ICS Study Hub is available at [http://icsstudyhub.xyz](http://icsstudyhub.xyz).

## Our next milestone...
Attached is a link to what we plan to accomplish in our next milestone:


[Milestone One](https://github.com/ics-study-hub/ics-study-hub/projects/1)


[Milestone Two](https://github.com/ics-study-hub/ics-study-hub/projects/2)

[Milestone Three](https://github.com/ics-study-hub/ics-study-hub/projects/3)


## User Guide:

### [Landing Page:](https://icsstudyhub.xyz/#/)
The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

### [Game Mechanics Page:](https://icsstudyhub.xyz/#/leaderboard)
Having a Leaderboard keeps the students motivated to study and in return they can earn rewards if they study hard enough.

### [User Profile Page:](https://icsstudyhub.xyz/#/user-profile)
User profile page displays the user's name, points, major, and expected graduation date.

### [Admin List Session:](https://icsstudyhub.xyz/#/admin)
The Admin List Session is the same as what the user will see except they have the ability to remove posts after the time has passed or the user wants the session to be deleted.

### [Admin Leaderboard:](https://icsstudyhub.xyz/#/leaderboardadmin)
The Leaderboard also the same where an admin can see the current leaderboard but if there was a student not following the rules then the admin is able to remove them from the leaderboard.

## Developer Guide
This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation
First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to the [ICS Study Hub page](https://github.com/ics-study-hub/ics-study-hub), and click the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system.  Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Finally, an additional library is required due to the interactive calendar we have installed in our site. Install this library with:

```
$ npm install --save @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid
```

### Running the system

 Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-study-hub/ics-study-hub/blob/master/app/package.json):

 ```
 $ meteor npm run start
 ```

 The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:


```
meteor npm run start

> meteor-application-template-react@ start C:\Users\Len Nguyen\Documents\GitHub\ics-study-hub\app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

### Walkthrough

The following sections describe the major features of this template.

### Directory structure

The top-level directory structure is:

```
app/        # holds the Meteor application sources
config/     # holds configuration files, such as settings.development.json
doc/        # holds developer documentation, user guides, etc.
.gitignore  # don't commit IntelliJ project files, node_modules, and settings.production.json
```

This structure separates documentation files (such as screenshots) and configuration files (such as the settings files) from the actual Meteor application.

The app/ directory has this structure:

```
client/
  main.html      # The boilerplate HTML with a "root" div to be manipulated by React.
  main.js        # import startup files.

imports/
  api/           # Define collections
    stuff/       # The Stuffs collection definition
  startup/       # Define code to run when system starts up (client-only, server-only, both)
    client/
    server/
  ui/
    layouts/     # Contains top-level layout (<App> component).
    pages/       # Contains components for each page.
    components/  # Contains page elements, some of which could appear on multiple pages.

node_modules/    # managed by npm

public/          # static assets (like images) can go here.

server/
   main.js       # import the server-side js files.

tests/			## Implementation of testcafe to test code
```

## Community Feedback

We would like to hear from you! Please take a few minutes to fill out this [ICS Study Hub Feeback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ7W4Z6Y9VuxuLD2P0JAtu_41zqQ6hBCeEqB-6jAdovnL34Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). Your feedback and suggestion are very important for us to understand our site and improve the site better!

### General Summary

After we collect some feedback and comment from the user and the form, overall, many of them enjoy using the application, such as how we build the calendar page so time itâ€™s more visual for each study session. Here are a few general things we need to improve to make our site better. First, our UI can be improved so it can look much better, such as change the style of the bottom, the style of the menu bar, and the from for creating session can be much more detailed. Also, we need to add the function that the user can be able to edit and add a profile picture for their account.
